I am happy to announce the public release of a curated collection of Praat and Python scripts that I have developed and refined over the past several years for use in phonetics research. The collection covers a range of common tasks including formant extraction, pitch tracking, vowel space analysis, and voice onset time measurement. Each script is documented with usage instructions and example data.

The motivation for releasing these scripts is straightforward: many of the tasks involved in acoustic phonetics research are repetitive and error-prone when done manually, yet the existing tooling is often fragmented across personal lab repositories and scattered documentation. By bringing these scripts together in a single well-organized repository, I hope to save other researchers time and reduce the barrier to entry for students who are just beginning to work with acoustic data.

The repository is available on GitHub under a permissive open-source license. Contributions and bug reports are welcome. I plan to continue adding scripts as new analysis needs arise in my own research, and I encourage others in the community to submit pull requests with their own tools and improvements.
