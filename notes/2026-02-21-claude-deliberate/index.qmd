I released [claude-deliberate](https://github.com/byseon/claude-deliberate), a plugin for Claude Code that adds structured multi-agent discussions and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to any project.

The idea is simple: before making an architectural decision, have AI agents argue for, against, and synthesize a middle ground — then record the outcome as an ADR. Everything is stored as markdown files in git, so decisions are versioned, searchable, and reviewable alongside the code they affect.

The plugin has three commands:

- `/deliberate:ideate` — explores a vague idea through focused questions, surfacing tradeoffs and sharpening it into a clear question
- `/deliberate:discuss` — runs a structured debate between agents and produces an ADR with rationale and tradeoffs
- `/deliberate:continue` — resumes the latest thread to add positions, reopen a decision, or start a follow-up

When no project-specific agents are configured, four built-in agents activate automatically: a Moderator who facilitates, an Advocate who argues for, a Critic who argues against, and a Synthesizer who finds middle ground. Projects that already have agents defined in `.claude/agents/` get those picked up automatically.

The tool grew out of work I did on [Soulcraft](https://github.com/byseon), where I found that the discussion and decision-recording features were the most broadly useful parts — applicable to any project, not just the specific team setup they were originally built for. Deliberate extracts and focuses that functionality into a standalone plugin.

There is also an optional Next.js dashboard for teams who want a real-time visual view of discussions and decisions, though the core plugin works entirely without it.

The repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/byseon/claude-deliberate) under the MIT license.
