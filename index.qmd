I am a researcher working at the intersection of phonetic science and speech technology. My research bridges human speech perception and production with computational approaches to language — from understanding how listeners process spoken words to building systems that automatically assess pronunciation and fluency in second language learners.

I am particularly interested in how insights from phonetics and psycholinguistics can inform better speech technology, and how computational tools can advance our understanding of spoken language.
